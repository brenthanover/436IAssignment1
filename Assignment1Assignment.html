		What are the functions of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Well basically, HTML is the "nouns", CSS is the "adjectives", and JavaScript is the "verbs". If you only have nouns in a sentence, it's pretty clunky and hard to convey information properly.
	</div>

	<div id="cssp">
		That's why you add "adjectives". CSS adds functionality by making things easier to read, aligned, with different fonts, colours, borders, etc. This is the exact same HTML code as the previous paragraph, but with CSS styling.
	</div>

	<div id="cssp">
		Then, JavaScript adds the "verbs" to a website. JavaScript makes more complicated sites work. With HTML and CSS you can make a website look like anything, but it can only do so much to add functionality. With Javascript you can add programming to a website. Try entering in a note and clicking submit below to see an example of a simple JavaScript function.

		<form>
			<input type="text" id="note1" placeholder="Write a note here">
			<input type="reset" value="Submit" onclick="addNote1();">
		</form>

		
		<ul id="notepad1">
		</ul>
		
	</div>

	<div>
		Now we have HTML and JavaScript, but no CSS. again, this is exactly the same HTML code as the previous section, but without the CSS styling. It functions the same but it's a lot harder to use!

		<form>
			<input type="text" id="note2" placeholder="Write a note here">
			<input type="reset" value="Submit" onclick="addNote2();">
		</form>

		
		<ul id="notepad2">
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div id="cssp">
